### What kind of data does the ODE support?

You can use the ODE to ingest folders, individual files like PDF, Excel sheets and even images. However, for its stable version the focus of the ODE is to support tabular data. In this sense, the app will only show a preview of tabular files.

### What kind of tables can I upload to the ODE?

You can upload csv, Excel and Google sheets that are publicly available (published online).

### How do I report an error?

To report an error, bug or an unexpected behavior, you send us an email to info@okfn.org  or, if you are a developer or you feel more comfortable reporting issues on GitHub, please go to the ODE repository [here](https://github.com/okfn/opendataeditor/issues) to provide a detailed explanation of the error.
