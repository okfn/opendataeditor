Open Data Editor (ODE) is a collaborative effort between developers, data practitioners, UX experts, volunteers, trainers, translators, and academics from different jurisdictions and backgrounds. Its goal is to provide an open tool available to everyone. Its development seeks to create an open, long-lasting, resilient and affordable tool that is good enough to solve people's problems while working with data. Its ultimate goal is to democratise Data and AI. 

The [Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN)](https://okfn.org/) has hosted, funded, and maintained the project since 2022. Institutions and individual collaborators have also contributed to its development. 

This document provides the necessary information about decision-making, collaboration, and participation in further developing the tool. 

# Decision-making
OKFN leads the vision and direction of ODE and shapes it through ongoing community feedback. A Product Owner catalyses the work, gathering input, listening to users, and steering the development accordingly.
The technical decisions are guided by the vision and mission of OKFN.

## Community participation
The Open Knowledge Foundation believes that great tools are built in conversation with people from diverse backgrounds. Anyone is **welcome to propose ideas or changes** to ODE.
You can:
* **Join our technical planning meetings**, held on the first and third Monday of each month, where we discuss and plan the product development. 
* **Start a discussion in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/okfn/opendataeditor/discussions)**. If you are not familiar with the platform, [here is a link](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/participating-in-a-discussion) to learn how to do it. 

**Note**: Our core team is small and working at a limited capacity. While we review all proposals, **response times may vary** depending on availability. We'll do our best to keep you informed and follow up as soon as possible.
