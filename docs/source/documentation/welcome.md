# Welcome!

The Open Data Editor (ODE) is a tool for non-technical data practitioners to explore and detect errors in tables. It also allows users to publish data on GitHub, Zenodo and CKAN portals.

ODE is powered by [Frictionless](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/), a toolkit created by the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) to help data practitioners find errors in data in an easier way.

In October 2023, the OKFN team released a beta version of the ODE for early adopters. Since then, and thanks to the support of [McGovern Foundation](https://www.mcgovern.org/), in March 2024 our team started working on a new product vision for the app which focused on reducing the number of features available to users to transform the app into a validation tool for tables.

This user guide has been updated to adapt its content for the ODE pre-release in September 2024.

Please be aware that our team is working on making improvements to the ODE for its stable release in December 2024. Therefore, you may encounter some actions that are not performing as expected.
