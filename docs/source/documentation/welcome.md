# Welcome!

The Open Data Editor (ODE) is a tool for non-technical data practitioners to explore and detect errors in tables.

ODE is powered by [Frictionless](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/), a toolkit created by the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) to help data practitioners find errors in data in an easier way.

This project was possible thanks to the support of [McGovern Foundation](https://www.mcgovern.org/).
